Basically - if the projects are time-bound and have nuclear funding, that is enough motivation for the actors to finish a small-scale project. Then, they find motivation to continue looking for funding, or move forward with the project because they already have established the relationships with their stakeholders.

What hasn't worked in general is that when it is a volunteer-led effort and those who are passionate volunteers also tend to live rich lives full of other priorities (family, day job, etc) :-) so it could be difficult to find time with them and things move quite slow. In other cases, actors tend to become self-serving and the volunteerism/engagement is more of a career move; so when their engagement is over and a project is done, they are ready to move on to a different career-building move.
